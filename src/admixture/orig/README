POPULATION ADMIXTURE ESTIMATION

  This document describes a set of programs for individual admixture estimation
  and related computational tasks. These programs include:

    admix     For each member of a set of individuals, estimate that person's
                population admixture given his/her genotypes at each of a
                set of reference markers and the population-specific allele
                frequencies for those markers.

    inform    Compute the informativeness of a set of markers for estimating
                individual admixture from a set of ancestral populations.

    ldtest    Test for allelic linkage disequilibrium between marker loci.

    hwtest    Test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at a marker.

    hetfst    Compute marker heterozygosity and Wright's locus-specific F
                statistic, F_st.

    count     Calculate allele and genotype frequencies based on the genotype
                data for a set of individuals.

  These programs were designed and written by Thomas Dyer and Jill Barnholtz-Sloan,
  copyright 2003, 2004, 2005.


BUILDING THE PROGRAMS

  The programs are written in C and Fortran. A Makefile is supplied which is
  suitable for use with the GNU compilers gcc and g77. To compile the programs,
  simply enter the command

    make all

  The programs have been successfully tested on the Solaris, Solaris x86, and
  Linux (Fedora Core 4) platforms.


USING THE PROGRAMS

  admix
  =====

    This program reads the marker genotype data for a set of individuals
    and computes maximum likelihood estimates of population admixture.
    These estimates are derived using the allele frequencies observed in
    the parent populations.


    Usage:  admix [-q] [-M missval] [-m mlist] [-g gridint] locfile
                  pedfile outfile

            locfile      locus file (marker info)
            pedfile      pedigree file (marker genotypes)
            outfile      output file

            options:
              -M missval   missing allele value in quotes, e.g. "0"
              -m mlist     read sets of markers from file mlist
              -g gridint   starting interval for grid search
              -q           suppress warning messages

      The missing allele value is used in genotypes to denote an untyped
      allele. The default missing value is an asterisk (*).

      Maximum likelihood estimates are found by searching over a grid
      of admixture proportions. The maximization procedure begins with
      a relatively coarse grid, determines the grid point for which the
      likelihood is maximized, and then conducts a search in the vicinity
      of this point with a finer grid (the interval is divided by 10).
      This process is repeated until the grid interval is less than or
      equal to 0.001. The default starting grid interval is 0.01.

    File formats:

      The locus file contains a set of lines for each marker. The first
      line in each set contains the marker name. The lines which follow
      contain per-population marker allele frequency information, one
      line per allele.  Each allele info line is blank- or tab-delimited
      and contains the allele name followed by one or more population
      allele frequencies.  The order of the allele frequencies is fixed,
      i.e. the i-th allele frequency on every allele info line is for the
      same population (the i-th population) and every allele info line
      must contain the same number of allele frequencies. Marker names
      and allele names can be arbitrary character strings but cannot
      contain embedded blanks or tabs.

      The pedigree file is blank- or tab-delimited and consists of one
      line per individual. Each line contains the following fields:
      family ID, individual ID, affection status (coded U/A or 1/2 for
      unaffected/affected), population ID, sex (coded M/F or 1/2 for
      male/female), and marker genotypes, one for each marker, in the
      order specified in the locus file. Each marker genotype consists
      of a pair of alleles separated by a blank or tab. Individual,
      family, and population IDs can be arbitrary character strings but
      cannot contain embedded blanks or tabs.

      In the example input files below, there are two marker genotypes
      for one individual.

        Locus file:
          marker1
          D23S999

        Pedigree file:
          Blow Joe 1 Caucasian M A a 123 131


       The output file reports the maximum likelihood estimate of
       population admixture, and its standard error, for each individual.

  inform
  ======

    This program computes the informativeness of a set of markers for
    estimating individual admixture from a set of ancestral populations.
    The expected information with respect to a particular set of
    admixture proportions is given by the determinant of a matirx with
    elements equal to the negative expected second partial derivative
    of the log likelihood function (the information matrix), which is
    derived using the marker allele frequencies observed in the parent
    populations.


    Usage:  inform [-aq] [-p plist] [-m mlist] [-g gridint] [-o ofile]
                   locfile [m1 ...]

            locfile      population-specific allele frequencies
            m1 ...       admixture proportions (optional)

            options:
              -p plist     read sets of admix proportions from file plist
              -m mlist     read sets of markers from file mlist
              -a           use all markers simultaneously
              -g gridint   grid interval
              -o ofile     output file
              -q           suppress warning messages

      If admixture proportions are not specified on the command line,
      informativeness is calculated at each point in an equally-spaced
      grid of proportions.


    File formats:

      The locus file is the same as that used by program admix and
      is described in the documentation for admix.

  ldtest
  ======

    This program tests for allelic linkage disequilibrium between marker
    loci. A test of 2-locus LD is performed for each ordered combination
    of two markers among the set of markers in the locus file, i.e. the
    first marker in the locus file is compared with the second marker,
    the second marker is compared with the third marker, the third marker
    with the fourth, and so on. If three or more markers are specified,
    a test of 3-locus LD is also performed for each ordered combination
    of three markers.

    Note that if the locus file includes markers located on more than one
    chromosome, LD tests will be made across chromosomal boundaries. Such
    tests should of course be ignored. The set of markers tested does not
    have to include all markers in the locus file, nor do the combinations
    of markers tested have to follow locus file order. A list of markers
    to be tested can be supplied and those markers will be compared in
    the order in which they occur in the list.


    Usage:  ldtest [-m mlist] [-M missval] pedfile allfreq outfile

            pedfile      pedigree file (marker genotypes)
            allfreq      allele frequencies file
            outfile      output file

            options:
              -m mlist     read markers to be tested from file mlist
              -M missval   missing allele value in quotes, e.g. "0"

      The marker list file consists of marker names, one name per line.

      The missing allele value is used in genotypes to denote an untyped
      allele. The default missing value is an asterisk (*).


    File formats:

      The pedigree file is the same as that used by program admix and
      is described in the documentation for admix.

      The allele frequencies file is generated by program count and is
      described in the documentation for count.

      The output file reports, for each combination of alleles from each
      set of two (or three) markers, the frequency of that combination of
      alleles, the allelic disequilibrium, the chi-square statistic for
      testing whether the disequilibrium differs significantly from zero,
      and 1 minus the p-value associated with that statistic.

  hwtest
  ======

    This program tests a marker locus for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. If
    the marker has three or more alleles, an input file is created for the
    program HWE (Guo and Thompson, 1992) which is then run to perform the
    exact test of Hardy-Weinberg proportion for multiple alleles. For a
    marker with fewer than three alleles, a chi-square test is performed.


    Usage:  hwtest [-au] [-p pop_id] [-o outfile] allfrq genfrq marker

            allfrq       allele frequencies input file
            genfrq       genotype frequencies input file
            marker       marker to be tested

            options:
              -a           include affecteds only
              -u           include unaffecteds only
              -p pop_id    include population pop_id only
              -o outfile   output file (required for program HWE)

      Note that if the marker being tested has more than 2 alleles, in
      which case program HWE will be run, an output file must be specified.


    File formats:

      The allele and genotype frequency files are generated by program
      count and are described in the documentation for count.

      The HWE input file is created in free format. The first line of the
      file contains the number of alleles, n. The next n lines contain the
      lower triangular entries of the observed genotype matrix. The first of
      these lines has a single entry, the observed number of occurrences of
      the genotype a1/a1, where a1 is the first of the n alleles. The next
      line has two entries, the number of occurrences of the genotypes a2/a1
      and a2/a2. And so forth. The last line of the input file contains the
      number of dememorization steps, the number of batches, and the size of
      each batch.

  hetfst
  ======

    This program calculates marker heterozygosity and Wright's locus-
    specific F statistic, F_st. Marker heterozygosity and its variance
    are computed for each population and for the total sample. F_st is
    derived both analytically and by jackknifing, and is reported for
    affected individuals, unaffected individuals, and the total sample.
    Jackknifing also yields an estimate of the variance in F_st.


    Usage:  hetfst [-M missval] pedfile genfrq hetout fstout

            pedfile      pedigree file (marker genotypes)
            genfrq       genotype frequencies file
            hetout       heterozygosity output file
            fstout       F statistics output file

            options:
              -M missval   missing allele value in quotes, e.g. "0"

      The missing allele value is used in genotypes to denote an untyped
      allele. The default missing value is an asterisk (*).


    File formats:

      The pedigree file is the same as that used by program admix and
      is described in the documentation for admix.

      The genotype frequencies file is generated by program count and
      is described in the documentation for count.

      The first output file reports the heterozygosity and its variance
      for each marker, first for the total sample and then for each of
      the populations. The second output file gives the analytic and
      jackknifed estimates of F_st and its variance for each marker,
      first for all individuals in the sample and then for unaffecteds
      and affecteds.

  count
  =====

    This program reads the genotype data for a set of individuals and
    generates a tally of the marker alleles and genotypes. Allele and
    genotype counts are broken down both by population and affection
    status. The counts are stored in files, one for allele counts and
    one for genotype counts, which are used by various other programs.


    Usage:  count [-M missval] locfile pedfile afrqout gfrqout

            locfile      locus file (marker names)
            pedfile      pedigree file (marker genotypes)
            afrqout      allele frequencies output file
            gfrqout      genotype frequencies output file

            options:
              -M missval   missing allele value in quotes, e.g. "0"

      The missing allele value is used in genotypes to denote an untyped
      allele. The default missing value is an asterisk (*).


    File formats:

      The locus file is simply a list of marker names, one name per line,
      in the order that the corresponding marker genotypes occur in the
      pedigree file. If a locus file containing allele frequencies (as
      described in the documentation for program admix) is used, the lines
      containing allele frequencies are simply ignored.

      The pedigree file is the same as that used by admix and is described
      in the documentation for admix.

      There are two blank-delimited output files - one for allele counts,
      the other for genotype counts. The first three fields on each line
      of these files are: marker name, affection status, and population ID.
      These fields are followed by an allele (or genotype) name, the number
      of occurrences of that allele (or genotype) among individuals within
      the specified population and having the specified affection status,
      and the corresponding allele (genotype) frequency. If the affection
      status field contains a hyphen (-), the count and frequency are for
      unaffected and affected indviduals combined. If the population ID
      field contains a hyphen, the count and frequency are for all
      populations combined. For example, the following line from a genotype
      counts file shows that there are 17 affected individuals in all
      populations combined who have the genotype 290/312 at marker D19S571,
      yielding a genotype frequency of 0.18478.

          D19S571 a - 290 312 17 0.18478
